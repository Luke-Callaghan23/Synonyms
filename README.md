# Synonyms
Small Website built with django/html/css/javascript to help finding synonyms without googling them all the time.

I made this website because I recently learned how to use django, and I wanted to build out an actual application
with it.  I wanted to make it because I find myself searching for synonyms for various words all the time when writing
papers, and it is very inconvenient to go to different, and sometimes fraudulent-looking websites for these synonyms.  
I often end up with multiple tabs devoted to these synoynms, so I decided to make an app that can collect multiple searches
into one page.
